## Vocabulary

## Consuming SSE in the browser

<div className='notes'>

The browser has a built-in API, `EventSource` to consume server-sent events.

1. Point to a URL that serves an event stream via `GET` request.
2. Listen to the `onmessage` event

</div>

```js eventSource.js
const eventSource = new EventSource("/api/my-event-stream");

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  // event.data is always a string. So you may need JSON.parse()
  console.log(event.data);
};
```
